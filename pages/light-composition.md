## Object Composition

The technique to use Objects to create a new Objects is called [Object Composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition). It models the relationship between object using a `has a` type of relationship. The newly created object is composed by using existing objects. The object use functionality from the existing objects.

You can use `Object Composition` to create a `TrafficLight` Object that is using the `Light` Objects. The Traffic Light object don't have to care how a Light is switched on or off, but it can rely on the fact that a light can be switched on and off.
