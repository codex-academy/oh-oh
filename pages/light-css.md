# A CSS Light

One of the main benefits of Object Orientation is Information hiding. And that the Object consumers, don't have to know exactly how an Object is working internally to use it. As long as the Object does what is required.

So let's assume that a client comes to you and ask for an Object that can simulate a light on a web page.

Something like this:

`Create a Light Class that will allow us to create Light Objects that will create a Light simulation in a web page. Lights can be switched on and off using a button on a web page.`

They want to be able to use the Light Object like this:

```javascript
var blueLight = new Light('lightOne', 'blue');

```
