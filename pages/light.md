# Light

We will explore the basic principles of Object Orientation using a `Light`.

What are the attributes and behaviour of a light? For the purpose of our discussion a `Light`:

    * can be switched on and off;
    * and it can have a colour.

## Member functions & attributes

Objects have behaviour and data, our Light have two member functions which is `on` and `off`. And it's got one attribute namely `colour`. If someone would like to use our `Light` object they would switch it on using the `on` member function. To switch it off they will be using the `off` member function. The colour of the light will be determined by the `colour` attribute.
